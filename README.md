Block module
===========

Your site might contain blocks that you want to make editable. Something of this would be a good example: footer, slogan, contact phone, email. This module is specially designed to handle that. It works like this - you create a new block and then render it somewhere in your theme template.

For API usage, please refer to its official documentation.
